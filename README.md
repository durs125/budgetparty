## Hello!

We're Team Budget Party! Our team includes developers, designers, a publisher, a curriculum writer and educators from [Open Austin](https://www.open-austin.org/), the [Austin Monitor](https://www.austinmonitor.com/), and Austin ISD.

We are interested in the health of our civic fabric and we are excited about the potential for youth inclusion in the decision making process of local government.

Thanks for coming here to learn more!

## Project Description

Budget Party helps people understand and augment a city budget for austin. 

Recently, Austin Budget Party has been [awarded a Mozilla Gigabit Community Fund grant](https://learning.mozilla.org/blog/mozilla-awards-241000-to-explore-the-intersection-of-gigabit-technology-and-civics-robotics-farming-and-more) to help design and develop a **Digital Mock City Council** experience with [austinbudget.party](https://austinbudget.party/).

The goal of the grant is to create an online, open-source, digital budget debate platform and curriculum designed for middle and high school students to explore civic challenges and priorities.

Open Austin contributors partnered with the [Capital of Texas Media Foundation](https://www.cotmf.org/), publisher of the [Austin Monitor](http://www.austinmonitor.com/), to improve the budget app, develop a teaching curriculum, and implement the program in 10 pilots schools in Austin.

You can read more on our [blog post](https://www.open-austin.org/blog/2017/02/08/budget-party-mozilla-gigabit-grant-announcement) announcing the grant and from the [original project proposal](https://github.com/open-austin/project-ideas/issues/70).

## Roadmap

At this stage, we have:

1. A (mostly) working web (version 1.0) [austinbudget.party](http://austinbudget.party/). This is our second iteration of a design and user workflow. The first prototype (version 0.1) was used at our first Game Night with Glasshouse Policy. This is the [feedback](https://github.com/open-austin/budgetparty/issues/66) we got from that event.
2. Designs for version 1.0 of Budget Party. See examples [here](https://github.com/open-austin/budgetparty/issues/74#issuecomment-284244078) and [here](https://github.com/open-austin/budgetparty/issues/73#issuecomment-284243962). [Sketch File](https://github.com/open-austin/budgetparty/files/880263/budgetParty-v2.2.sketch.zip)
3. A [curriculum](https://github.com/open-austin/budgetparty/files/1009706/Budget.Game.Binder.pdf) to provide context for middle school and high school students for understanding how the City Council makes decisions. We are looking for opportunities to use the curriculum in classes with the Budget Party app.

We are currently working on bug fixes and more features to be included in v1.1. We are also looking for feedback from users and testing with educators.

An awesome teacher at Lanier High School, Laurie Beaman, laurie.beaman@austinisd.org, designed and wrote a Curriculum Binder for teaching high schoolers about the City Budget. Check it out here:
[Budget Game Binder PDF](https://github.com/open-austin/budgetparty/files/1009706/Budget.Game.Binder.pdf)

We'd like to convert this PDF document into HTML to make it accessible for more educators to view and use. If you're interested in helping with this task, check out [this issue](https://github.com/open-austin/budgetparty/issues/128) and let's chat!

### Design

Here is a link to our [design assets and documentation](./design). Here are [open issues labeled "Design"](https://github.com/open-austin/hack-the-budget/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adesign) where you can discuss, provide feedback or volunteer to help.

### Development

The Budget Party app is primarily written in javascript and leans heavily into the libraries [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Redux](http://redux.js.org/).
